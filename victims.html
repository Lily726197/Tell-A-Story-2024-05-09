        <p>Gacy's first known victim was 16-year-old Timothy McCoy. After luring him into his house for 
            sex, Gacy stood in the bedroom doorway, and seeing McCoy with a knife, he'd rushed to attack the 16-year-old; 
            Wrestling the knife away fom him and stabbing him to death. He later discovered that McCoy 
            wasn't planning on killing him, he was just making breakfast. Nevertheless, Gacy recieved 
            sexual gratification from the event.</p>
        <p>Another victim, 18-year-old John Butkovich was lured into Gacy's house with a promise to discuss overdue pay. 
            Once there, Gacy gave him alcohol, tricked into putting handcuffs on, and strangled him. 19-year-old 
            Robert Donnelly was abducted by Gacy from a bus stop. Once at his house, he raped and tortured 
            Donnelly, dunking him repeatedly into a bathtub. Donnelly was in so much pain that he begged Gacy 
            to kill him, but he let him go. Donnelly later reported him to the police and they investigated 
            him for sex slavery. Other victims included Francis Wayne Alexander, Gregory Godzik, and Robert 
            Piest.</p>

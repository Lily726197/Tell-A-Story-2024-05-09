        <p>Despite not graduating high school, Gacy attended and graduated from Northwestern Business 
            College in Chicago. He was a member of Chicago's Jolly Joker Clown Club and attended children's 
            birthday parties. In 1968, he was accused of sexually assaulting a teenage boy, but he denied 
            and persuaded one of his employees to assault the victim in order to stop him from testifying. 
            He was convicted and served a 10-year prison sentence, after which his wife divorced him.</p>
        <p>Gacy was released on parole in the summer of 1970, but was arrested the following year, after 
            another boy claimed he lured him into his car and forced him to have sex. The charges were 
            dropped when the boy didn't appear in trial. After these events, with his mom's financial assistance, Gacy 
            bought a new house where all his future murders would take place.</p>

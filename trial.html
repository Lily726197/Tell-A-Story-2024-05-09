        <p>Gacy’s trial began on February 6, 1980. With Gacy having already confessed to the crimes, 
            the arguments were focused on whether he could be declared insane and thus remitted to a state 
            mental facility. Gacy spent hundreds of hours with doctors at the Menard Correctional Center in Chester, Illinois, 
            and underwent a series of psychologist tests. Gacy tried to argue he had multiple personality disorder and that his
             mind was split between the personalities of a contractor, clown, politician, and police officer named “Bad Jack.” </p>
        <p>On March 12, 1980, after a short jury deliberation, Gacy was found guilty of committing the 33 murders, and henceforth became known
             as one of the most ruthless serial killers in American history. Gacy was imprisoned at the Menard Correctional Center 
             in Chester for 14 years, appealing the sentence and offering contradictory statements on the murders in interviews. 
             After the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear Gacy’s final appeal in October 1993, an execution date was set for May 10,
              1994 at the Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill, Illinois. Before his death, Gacy said the victim’s families 
              would get no comfort from his death and accused the state of murdering him. His last words were reportedly “Kiss my a––,”
               but the prosecutor who tried the case and attended his execution said Gacy didn’t speak in his final moments. Gacy was 
               executed by lethal injection. Netflix released Conversations with a Killer: The John Wayne Gacy Tapes on April 20, 2022.
               Featuring interviews with people involved with the case and archival audio footage from Gacy’s incarceration, it is the 
               second entry in Netflix's Conversations with a Killer documentary series, the first of which focused on serial killer Ted Bundy.</p>

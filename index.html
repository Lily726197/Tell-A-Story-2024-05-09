        <p>John Wayne Gacy is one of the most influential serial killers of the 
            20th century. Known as the "Killer Clown" because he often dressed
            as a clown, Gacy is responsible for the murder of 33 boys and young
            men in the Chicago area during the 1970s. His pleading innocent because
            he was schizophrenic led to him being proved guilty of all the murders
            and his eventual execution via lethal injection in 1994. This is his 
            story. Click the links below to read the full story of how Gacy terrorized these victims.</p>
